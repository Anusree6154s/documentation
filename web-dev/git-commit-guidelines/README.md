## Guidelines to cleaner git commits

### Standardized documentation followed for cleaner git commits
- [Conventional Commit (Standard one)](https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit)
- [Commit messages guide (Simplified one - found it useful)](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [Add emojis in git commits (For personal ones)](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji)

### To integrate git commit message helper to vs-code
- #### via cli
  - [commitizen-cli documentation](https://github.com/andostronaut/commitizen-code)
  - #### Method:
    - `npm i -g commitizen-cli` in vscode terminal
    - to use either `commitizen-cli` or `npx commitizen-cli (to skip first step)`
    - then follow terminal guidelines
- #### vscode extension: not developed yet
