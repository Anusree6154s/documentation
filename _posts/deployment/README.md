### netlify:

- using netlify-cli for cli, can do from portal too
- only for static websites
- can do for private gitlab instances (along with github, gitlab, etc) (so from crio cli for static websites)
- can do for webservers too but require to do using serverless-http which didnt work right for me (methods exist in internet)

### render

- using cli is paid, portal is free
- specially for webservers
- cannot do for private gitlab instances (so not from crio cli)
