<h2 id="basic"><u>Basic</u></h2>

<p>Low-level design (LLD) is the process of detailing the components and modules of a system, creating a blueprint that focuses on the implementation aspects. It is concerned with specifying the internal structure and interactions of individual modules and their components.</p>

<h4 id="object-oriented-programming-oop-fundamentals"><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals</strong></h4>

<p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) together. OOP enables better organization, reusability, and scalability in programming.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class:</strong> A blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes and behaviors.</li>
      <li><strong>Object:</strong> An instance of a class containing real values instead of variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inheritance:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reuse.</li>
      <li>Example: A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dog</code> class can inherit from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Animal</code> class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of the object’s components (through access modifiers like private, protected).</li>
      <li>This is done using getters and setters to access private fields.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Polymorphism:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Polymorphism means “many shapes” and refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations of the same method.</li>
      <li>It can be achieved through <strong>method overriding</strong> (runtime polymorphism) and <strong>method overloading</strong> (compile-time polymorphism).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abstraction hides the complexity by exposing only essential features of an object. It can be achieved through abstract classes or interfaces, allowing the user to focus on high-level operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="class-design-and-relationships"><strong>Class Design and Relationships</strong></h3>

<p>Class design involves creating the structure and behavior of classes, ensuring that classes are well-organized and efficient.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cohesion:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a class or module are. High cohesion means the class has a clear, single responsibility, leading to better maintainability and readability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coupling:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coupling refers to the degree of dependence between classes. Low coupling means fewer dependencies between classes, which makes the system more flexible and easier to change.</li>
      <li>Ideally, classes should be <strong>loosely coupled</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Relationships:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> A “has-a” relationship, where one object contains another, but the contained object can exist independently of the container.</li>
      <li><strong>Composition:</strong> A stronger form of aggregation where the contained object cannot exist without the container. It’s a “part-of” relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Association:</strong> A relationship where objects can interact with each other, typically by using each other’s methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> A weaker relationship, where one object relies on another for certain functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="design-patterns-foundational"><strong>Design Patterns (Foundational)</strong></h3>

<p>Design patterns are standard solutions to common design problems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Singleton:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Often used for resources like database connections or configuration settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Factory Method:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It decouples object creation from its usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Observer:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adapter:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. The adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="basic-uml-diagrams"><strong>Basic UML Diagrams</strong></h3>

<p>Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized way to visualize the design of a system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Class Diagrams:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Represent the static structure of a system, showing the system’s classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sequence Diagrams:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Illustrate how objects interact in a particular sequence of events. They focus on the order of messages exchanged between objects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Component Diagrams:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show the components or modules of a system and their interactions. They provide a high-level view of system architecture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="error-handling-and-exception-design"><strong>Error Handling and Exception Design</strong></h3>

<p>Designing robust systems requires handling errors gracefully.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exception Hierarchies:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Organizing exceptions into a hierarchy allows for better management and classification of errors. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IOException</code> could be a subclass of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Exception</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graceful Error Handling Mechanisms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures that an application does not crash due to errors and can recover or provide useful feedback to users. Using try-catch blocks and handling exceptions at appropriate levels in the system is crucial.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="coding-principles"><strong>Coding Principles</strong></h3>

<p>These principles help maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Avoid duplication by ensuring that every piece of knowledge or logic has a single, unambiguous representation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focus on simplicity. The simpler a solution is, the easier it is to maintain and extend.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid adding functionality until it’s necessary. This principle helps prevent overengineering and unnecessary complexity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="code-modularity"><strong>Code Modularity</strong></h3>

<p>Designing software with modular components improves reusability, testability, and maintainability.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Designing Modules or Components for Reusability and Testability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each module should have a single responsibility, be easily reusable across the system, and be easy to test in isolation (using unit tests).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="data-structures"><strong>Data Structures</strong></h3>

<p>Data structures are used to store and organize data efficiently.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Array:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A collection of elements, identified by index or key. Fixed in size.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Linked List:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are linked using pointers. It can grow dynamically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stack:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A collection where elements are added and removed in a Last In First Out (LIFO) order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Queue:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A collection where elements are added and removed in a First In First Out (FIFO) order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hash Table:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Basic Tree Structures (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Binary Tree:</strong> A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.</li>
      <li><strong>Binary Search Tree:</strong> A binary tree where nodes are arranged such that for each node, its left child is smaller and its right child is larger.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="testing-fundamentals"><strong>Testing Fundamentals</strong></h3>

<p>Testing is crucial to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unit Testing:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure that each part functions as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mocking and Stubbing:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mocking:</strong> Creating fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects for testing purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Stubbing:</strong> Providing predefined responses to function calls during testing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integration Testing Basics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on testing the interactions between different components or systems to ensure that they work together as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="advanced"><u>Advanced</u></h2>

<p>Low-level design refers to the detailed design of individual components, functions, and modules within a system. Advanced topics delve into the strategies for creating more efficient and maintainable designs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advanced-design-patterns"><strong>Advanced Design Patterns</strong></h3>

<p>Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. Here’s an overview of the ones you listed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Builder Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for different representations to be created using the same construction process.</li>
      <li>Useful for constructing objects with many parameters or optional configurations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prototype Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Used to create new objects by copying an existing object, often known as the prototype.</li>
      <li>Helps in creating objects with complex states without knowing their exact class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mediator Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact, preventing direct communication between them.</li>
      <li>Used to reduce dependencies between objects and to centralize communication logic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Allows a chain of objects to handle a request, passing it along the chain until one object processes it.</li>
      <li>Useful for situations where multiple handlers might need to process a request, like in event processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.</li>
      <li>Often used in undo/redo systems or event handling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Visitor Pattern</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify the objects themselves.</li>
      <li>Used to separate an algorithm from the objects it operates on, ideal for operations on complex object structures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decorator Pattern</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.</li>
      <li>Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="solid-principles"><strong>SOLID Principles</strong></h3>

<p>SOLID is a set of principles that guide software design to make systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have one job or responsibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.</li>
      <li>New functionality should be added through extension, not by modifying existing code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.</li>
      <li>Subtypes must behave in a way that doesn’t alter the expected behavior of the base class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use.</li>
      <li>Split larger interfaces into smaller ones so that clients only implement what they need.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</li>
      <li>Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="clean-code-practices"><strong>Clean Code Practices</strong></h3>

<p>Clean code is code that is easy to read, maintain, and understand. Some important practices are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Writing maintainable, readable, and scalable code</strong>: Code should be easy to understand and adapt to changing requirements. It’s about clarity over cleverness.</li>
  <li><strong>Refactoring legacy code</strong>: Continuously improving and simplifying existing code, without changing its behavior, to keep it maintainable.</li>
  <li><strong>Effective naming conventions</strong>: Descriptive, clear, and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes that convey their purpose.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="advanced-uml-diagrams"><strong>Advanced UML Diagrams</strong></h3>

<p>UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams help visualize system design and architecture. Advanced UML diagrams include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>State Diagrams</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Illustrate the states an object can be in and the transitions between these states.</li>
      <li>Useful in modeling finite state machines or complex lifecycle processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Activity Diagrams</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Represent workflows of activities and actions, often used to show the flow of control or data in a process.</li>
      <li>Useful for modeling business processes or algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deployment Diagrams</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show the physical deployment of artifacts (like code and database) on hardware nodes.</li>
      <li>Helpful in understanding the distribution of software in a system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="concurrency-and-parallelism"><strong>Concurrency and Parallelism</strong></h3>

<p>Concurrency involves managing multiple tasks at once, while parallelism is executing tasks simultaneously. Key topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thread safety and synchronization</strong>: Ensures that shared data is protected from race conditions and inconsistent states when accessed by multiple threads.</li>
  <li><strong>Deadlock detection and prevention</strong>: Identifying and avoiding situations where threads are stuck waiting on each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous programming</strong>: Writing programs that can perform tasks in the background without blocking the main thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Design patterns for concurrency</strong>: Patterns like <strong>Producer-Consumer</strong> and <strong>Thread Pool</strong> manage concurrency by structuring how tasks are processed.</li>

<h3 id="microservices-and-api-design"><strong>Microservices and API Design</strong></h3>

<p>Microservices involve designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. Key considerations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API versioning and design best practices</strong>: Ensuring backward compatibility while evolving APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract-first design</strong>: Designing the API contract (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) before implementing the API.</li>
  <li><strong>API security</strong>: Authenticating and authorizing users or services using techniques like OAuth.</li>
  <li><strong>Fault tolerance patterns</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Circuit Breaker</strong>: Prevents system overload by detecting failures.</li>
      <li><strong>Retry</strong>: Retries a failed operation a set number of times.</li>
      <li><strong>Bulkhead</strong>: Isolates failure to prevent it from affecting the whole system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="data-intensive-design"><strong>Data-Intensive Design</strong></h3>

<p>Designing systems that deal with large volumes of data. Key considerations are:</p>
