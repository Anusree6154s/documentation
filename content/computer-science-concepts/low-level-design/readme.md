## <u>Basic</u>

Low-level design (LLD) is the process of detailing the components and modules of a system, creating a blueprint that focuses on the implementation aspects. It is concerned with specifying the internal structure and interactions of individual modules and their components.

#### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals**

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) together. OOP enables better organization, reusability, and scalability in programming.

1. **Classes and Objects:**

   - **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes and behaviors.
   - **Object:** An instance of a class containing real values instead of variables.

2. **Inheritance:**

   - A mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reuse.
   - Example: A `Dog` class can inherit from a `Animal` class.

3. **Encapsulation:**

   - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components (through access modifiers like private, protected).
   - This is done using getters and setters to access private fields.

4. **Polymorphism:**

   - Polymorphism means "many shapes" and refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations of the same method.
   - It can be achieved through **method overriding** (runtime polymorphism) and **method overloading** (compile-time polymorphism).

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction hides the complexity by exposing only essential features of an object. It can be achieved through abstract classes or interfaces, allowing the user to focus on high-level operations.

---

### **Class Design and Relationships**

Class design involves creating the structure and behavior of classes, ensuring that classes are well-organized and efficient.

1. **Cohesion:**

   - Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a class or module are. High cohesion means the class has a clear, single responsibility, leading to better maintainability and readability.

2. **Coupling:**

   - Coupling refers to the degree of dependence between classes. Low coupling means fewer dependencies between classes, which makes the system more flexible and easier to change.
   - Ideally, classes should be **loosely coupled**.

3. **Relationships:**
   - **Aggregation:** A "has-a" relationship, where one object contains another, but the contained object can exist independently of the container.
   - **Composition:** A stronger form of aggregation where the contained object cannot exist without the container. It’s a "part-of" relationship.
   - **Association:** A relationship where objects can interact with each other, typically by using each other’s methods.
   - **Dependency:** A weaker relationship, where one object relies on another for certain functionality.

---

### **Design Patterns (Foundational)**

Design patterns are standard solutions to common design problems.

1. **Singleton:**

   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Often used for resources like database connections or configuration settings.

2. **Factory Method:**

   - Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It decouples object creation from its usage.

3. **Strategy:**

   - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime.

4. **Observer:**

   - Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.

5. **Adapter:**
   - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. The adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

---

### **Basic UML Diagrams**

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized way to visualize the design of a system.

1. **Class Diagrams:**

   - Represent the static structure of a system, showing the system’s classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.

2. **Sequence Diagrams:**

   - Illustrate how objects interact in a particular sequence of events. They focus on the order of messages exchanged between objects.

3. **Component Diagrams:**
   - Show the components or modules of a system and their interactions. They provide a high-level view of system architecture.

---

### **Error Handling and Exception Design**

Designing robust systems requires handling errors gracefully.

1. **Exception Hierarchies:**

   - Organizing exceptions into a hierarchy allows for better management and classification of errors. For example, `IOException` could be a subclass of `Exception`.

2. **Graceful Error Handling Mechanisms:**
   - Ensures that an application does not crash due to errors and can recover or provide useful feedback to users. Using try-catch blocks and handling exceptions at appropriate levels in the system is crucial.

---

### **Coding Principles**

These principles help maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code.

1. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):**

   - Avoid duplication by ensuring that every piece of knowledge or logic has a single, unambiguous representation.

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**

   - Focus on simplicity. The simpler a solution is, the easier it is to maintain and extend.

3. **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It):**
   - Avoid adding functionality until it's necessary. This principle helps prevent overengineering and unnecessary complexity.

---

### **Code Modularity**

Designing software with modular components improves reusability, testability, and maintainability.

1. **Designing Modules or Components for Reusability and Testability:**
   - Each module should have a single responsibility, be easily reusable across the system, and be easy to test in isolation (using unit tests).

---

### **Data Structures**

Data structures are used to store and organize data efficiently.

1. **Array:**

   - A collection of elements, identified by index or key. Fixed in size.

2. **Linked List:**

   - A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are linked using pointers. It can grow dynamically.

3. **Stack:**

   - A collection where elements are added and removed in a Last In First Out (LIFO) order.

4. **Queue:**

   - A collection where elements are added and removed in a First In First Out (FIFO) order.

5. **Hash Table:**

   - A data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys.

6. **Basic Tree Structures (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree):**
   - **Binary Tree:** A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
   - **Binary Search Tree:** A binary tree where nodes are arranged such that for each node, its left child is smaller and its right child is larger.

---

### **Testing Fundamentals**

Testing is crucial to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.

1. **Unit Testing:**

   - Involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure that each part functions as expected.

2. **Mocking and Stubbing:**

   - **Mocking:** Creating fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects for testing purposes.
   - **Stubbing:** Providing predefined responses to function calls during testing.

3. **Integration Testing Basics:**
   - Focuses on testing the interactions between different components or systems to ensure that they work together as expected.

## <u>Advanced</u>

Low-level design refers to the detailed design of individual components, functions, and modules within a system. Advanced topics delve into the strategies for creating more efficient and maintainable designs.

### **Advanced Design Patterns**

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. Here's an overview of the ones you listed:

1. **Builder Pattern**

   - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for different representations to be created using the same construction process.
   - Useful for constructing objects with many parameters or optional configurations.

2. **Prototype Pattern**

   - Used to create new objects by copying an existing object, often known as the prototype.
   - Helps in creating objects with complex states without knowing their exact class.

3. **Mediator Pattern**

   - Defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact, preventing direct communication between them.
   - Used to reduce dependencies between objects and to centralize communication logic.

4. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

   - Allows a chain of objects to handle a request, passing it along the chain until one object processes it.
   - Useful for situations where multiple handlers might need to process a request, like in event processing.

5. **Command Pattern**

   - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
   - Often used in undo/redo systems or event handling.

6. **Visitor Pattern**

   - Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify the objects themselves.
   - Used to separate an algorithm from the objects it operates on, ideal for operations on complex object structures.

7. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   - Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

---

### **SOLID Principles**

SOLID is a set of principles that guide software design to make systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have one job or responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - New functionality should be added through extension, not by modifying existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Subtypes must behave in a way that doesn’t alter the expected behavior of the base class.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   - A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use.
   - Split larger interfaces into smaller ones so that clients only implement what they need.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

---

### **Clean Code Practices**

Clean code is code that is easy to read, maintain, and understand. Some important practices are:

- **Writing maintainable, readable, and scalable code**: Code should be easy to understand and adapt to changing requirements. It’s about clarity over cleverness.
- **Refactoring legacy code**: Continuously improving and simplifying existing code, without changing its behavior, to keep it maintainable.
- **Effective naming conventions**: Descriptive, clear, and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes that convey their purpose.

---

### **Advanced UML Diagrams**

UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams help visualize system design and architecture. Advanced UML diagrams include:

1. **State Diagrams**

   - Illustrate the states an object can be in and the transitions between these states.
   - Useful in modeling finite state machines or complex lifecycle processes.

2. **Activity Diagrams**

   - Represent workflows of activities and actions, often used to show the flow of control or data in a process.
   - Useful for modeling business processes or algorithms.

3. **Deployment Diagrams**
   - Show the physical deployment of artifacts (like code and database) on hardware nodes.
   - Helpful in understanding the distribution of software in a system.

---

### **Concurrency and Parallelism**

Concurrency involves managing multiple tasks at once, while parallelism is executing tasks simultaneously. Key topics include:

- **Thread safety and synchronization**: Ensures that shared data is protected from race conditions and inconsistent states when accessed by multiple threads.
- **Deadlock detection and prevention**: Identifying and avoiding situations where threads are stuck waiting on each other.
- **Asynchronous programming**: Writing programs that can perform tasks in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Design patterns for concurrency**: Patterns like **Producer-Consumer** and **Thread Pool** manage concurrency by structuring how tasks are processed.

---

### **Microservices and API Design**

Microservices involve designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. Key considerations are:

- **API versioning and design best practices**: Ensuring backward compatibility while evolving APIs.
- **Contract-first design**: Designing the API contract (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) before implementing the API.
- **API security**: Authenticating and authorizing users or services using techniques like OAuth.
- **Fault tolerance patterns**:
  - **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents system overload by detecting failures.
  - **Retry**: Retries a failed operation a set number of times.
  - **Bulkhead**: Isolates failure to prevent it from affecting the whole system.

---

### **Data-Intensive Design**

Designing systems that deal with large volumes of data. Key considerations are:

- **Advanced data structures**: Structures like **AVL trees**, **Red-Black Trees**, **Tries**, and **Graphs** help in optimizing data retrieval and storage.
- **Caching mechanisms**: Techniques like **LRU cache** reduce repeated access to slow resources like databases.
- **Memory optimization techniques**: Efficient use of memory through data structure design, object pooling, and garbage collection optimization.

---

### **Advanced Testing**

Advanced testing techniques ensure high-quality and reliable software:

- **Test-driven development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code to guide development and ensure correctness.
- **Behavior-driven development (BDD)**: Extending TDD by writing tests in a more natural language format, describing behaviors.
- **Integration and end-to-end testing**: Testing the interaction of multiple components and the entire system from the user’s perspective.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

Performance is critical for high-traffic systems:

- **Big-O complexity analysis**: Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms to choose efficient solutions.
- **Profiling and optimization**: Identifying and removing performance bottlenecks in your code.
- **Database query optimization**: Writing efficient SQL queries and designing efficient database schemas.

---

### **Event-Driven Architecture**

Event-driven architecture (EDA) revolves around systems reacting to events or changes in state:

- **Event sourcing**: Storing all changes to application state as a sequence of events.
- **CQRS**: Separates the command (write) and query (read) sides of a system, allowing for more scalable solutions.
- **Messaging systems**: Technologies like **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** facilitate the decoupling of system components by enabling asynchronous communication.

---

### **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

DDD focuses on modeling systems based on the domain they are solving problems for:

- **Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates**: Core building blocks of DDD, where entities have identities, value objects have no identity, and aggregates are collections of related entities.
- **Repositories**: Abstraction for accessing and persisting aggregates.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Defining clear boundaries around a specific part of the domain, ensuring teams work with a consistent model.
- **Ubiquitous language**: A common language shared by both developers and business experts to describe the system and its domain.

---

### **Security and Resilience in Design**

Security and resilience are key to creating robust systems:

- **Secure coding practices**: Writing code to protect against vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- **Threat modeling and mitigation**: Identifying potential threats and designing the system to mitigate those risks.
- **Resilient system design**: Patterns like **fallbacks**, **circuit breakers**, and **retry mechanisms** to ensure a system continues to function even when some components fail.

### **Behavioral and Problem-Solving LLD Questions**

1. **Design a system that must be both highly available and partition-tolerant (using CAP Theorem):**

   - How would you make trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance?
   - How would you design for eventual consistency in this system?

2. **How would you design a system with the following constraints:**

   - High throughput and low latency.
   - Fault tolerance and high availability.
   - Real-time data processing.
   - How would you balance these requirements in your design?

3. **Design a system where multiple components need to collaborate, but you cannot modify all the components:**

   - How would you implement communication between these components?
   - How would you ensure that each component can evolve independently?

4. **How would you design a system that needs to ensure data consistency across multiple data stores (e.g., SQL and NoSQL)?**
   - What patterns would you apply (e.g., event sourcing, CQRS)?
   - How would you handle conflicts and ensure the system remains consistent?

### **System Design Trade-offs and Optimizations**

1. **How would you optimize the performance of a system under heavy load (e.g., millions of requests per second)?**

   - How would you handle bottlenecks in databases, CPU, memory, or network?
   - How would you scale the system horizontally and vertically?

2. **Explain how you would handle data migrations when updating a system:**

   - How would you ensure minimal downtime?
   - How would you design the system to be backward compatible during the migration?

3. **Design a system that requires high fault tolerance but also needs to perform background tasks at regular intervals (e.g., scheduled jobs):**
   - How would you ensure that tasks complete even if part of the system fails?
   - How would you schedule tasks without blocking critical system processes?

### **Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures Questions**

1. **Design an autocomplete feature using a trie data structure:**

   - How would you implement the search and insert operations efficiently?
   - How would you scale the autocomplete service to handle large dictionaries?

2. **Design a distributed rate limiter for a global API:**
   - How would you ensure fair distribution of requests and prevent abuse?
   - How would you handle distributed state in the rate limiter?
